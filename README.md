# pymlkit
Python tools for preprocessing data and building and evaluating machine learning models

### !(Currently in Early Development)! ###

## Notes:
    This package developed from a collection of miscellaneous functions that I wrote while writing
    machine learning models, and this project serves to organize these functions into a more centralized
    package for ease of use. 
    
    Many of the functions serve as wrappers to other packages such as scikit-learn, mlxtend and nltk. Additionally,
    heavy use is made of the pandas DataFrame data structure. While it is possible to use many of the functions
    for data not in this format, it is advised to do so.
    
    Please feel free to send comments or criticisms to cameron@tutanota.com.

## Planned:
1. preprocessing.py: Functions for cleaning, imputing, feature mapping and scaling.
2. model_select.py: Functions for choosing models, including cross-validation and grid search.
3. model_eval.py: Accuracy assessments and analysis of model output.
4. nlp.py: Functions to aid in natural language processing
