# pymlkit
Python tools for preprocessing data and building and evaluating machine learning models

### !(Currently in Early Development)! ###

## Notes:
    This package developed from a collection of miscellaneous functions that I wrote while writing
    machine learning models, and this project serves to organize these functions into a more centralized
    package for ease of use. Please feel free to send comments or criticisms to cameron@tutanota.com.

## Planned:
1. preprocessing.py: Functions for cleaning, imputing, feature mapping and scaling.
2. model_select.py: Functions for choosing models, including cross-validation and grid search.
3. model_eval: Accuracy assessments and analysis of model output.
4. nlp: Functions to aid in natural language processing
